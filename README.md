# ArtificialNeuralNetwork

# About
Multi-purpose Artificial Neural Network implemented in Python using numpy.

# Using
1.Copy the ArtificialNeuralNetwork class code. 

(In the examples below refer to the methods documentation in the class file for more detail on the input parameters) 

2.Import the file where you saved the class to your script, e.g:

   `import ArtificialNeuralNetwork as nn` - (assuming the filename is *ArtificialNeuralNetwork.py*)
  
3.Create a new instance using the constructor, e.g: 

   `nn.ArtificialNeuralNetwork(arg)` - (assuming the filename was imported as specified above)

4.Train the model using the train method, e.g:

    `nn.train(*args)`

5.Use the ANN to predict using the predict method, e.g:

   `nn.predict(arg)`
